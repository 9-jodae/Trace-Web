# AI harness map

Read `AGENTS.md` first. Then read the workflow for the task and any relevant rule in this directory. Consult the Korean `docs/` files for product context and detailed procedures.

Priority: explicit user request, `AGENTS.md`, applicable `docs/ai/` workflow or rule, then tool-specific wrapper. Edit shared rules only in `AGENTS.md` or `docs/ai/`; keep `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/prompts/` thin.
