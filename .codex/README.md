# Codex in this repository

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` as repository instructions. Read `docs/ai/README.md` for the shared workflow map. Use the paired files in `.codex/prompts/` as manual task prompts: refer to or paste the relevant file when starting a task. Automatic discovery of project `.codex/prompts/` was not verified by the installed CLI help or official documentation, so these files do not depend on a custom prompt loader.

Official Codex documentation supports repository skills under `.agents/skills/` and project settings in `.codex/config.toml` for trusted projects. This repository uses thin Codex skills in `.agents/skills/` and needs no project settings. The shared procedures live in `docs/ai/`.
